Responsive Design


"Responsive Design" is a web project featuring an island paradise crafted with HTML and CSS. As a solo endeavor, this project allowed me to apply the concepts learned during my course, bringing to life a design inspired by Figma. Prioritizing responsive design principles, the project guarantees a seamless experience on both standard screens and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
